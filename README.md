# SysMon

## What is SysMon ?
SysMon is a PyQt Conky like app being built specifically for the Mac OS environment.

## Road so far
Currently the app is in its infant stage only showing the current time and date.

## Vision for the app:

### System Monitoring
My vision for this app will be an app able to show detailed information of the users system, using various charts all pulling in live data

### Web App Monitoring
I hope to have options to link user web applications to be able to monitor them from their desktop, giving feedback on the web app status i.e uptime, crashes and traffic.

### Server Monitoring
Users will be able to keep track on their linked servers and issue terminal commands.
